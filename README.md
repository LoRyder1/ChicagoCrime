CrimeChic

# Take this Chicago crime data and tie it into another data set or API of your choosing. The goal is to add insight to the Chicago data set.  If the dataset is too large it is completely fine to use just the 2013 data (Clicking this will trigger the download of the 2013 data as a .csv (70mb)).  Use any tool of your choice to visualize your findings in an interesting and interactive way. Send us a link to a published html page containing your project. Be sure to include links to your code, a brief explanation of your work, and challenges you faced.

# Some recommendations, but by no means required:
# A few complementary data sets you could use: US Local Climatological Data, US Socioeconomic Data, Sunlight Labs, Data.gov
# A few good visualization tools: d3, Protovis, Vida (good for quick d3 iteration), Raphael, Plotly
# A few free places to publish: Github pages, Heroku, iPython
